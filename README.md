# Pre-work - *Tip Calculator App*

**Preword** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Matthew Zuberbuhler**

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [X] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [X] UI animations
* [X] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [X] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [X] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

- My app has both slider and segment controls for tip percentages.
- There is also dark mode button in settings menu.
- User can adjust their 3 most preferred tip percentages for the segment control.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

- It was very challenging to figure out how to store data persistently across different views and app restarts.
- Additionally, I am having trouble keeping my code organized so I think I need to learn some design patterns for IOS dev.
